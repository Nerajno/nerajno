## Hi there ✋🏽, Nerando here. 

## Brief Bio 
As a full-stack developer, I have served in a DevOps capacity while assisting a team of nine developers on a proprietary mortgage web platform. Our team worked on new feature development in a modern Expo-based React/React Native SPA front-end codebase plus creation of: Node.js back-end, integration of middleware, new user workflows and adding functionality for 5,000 concurrent users.

As Quality Assurance / Software Engineer with a local Atlanta firm, I was responsible for creating and reviewing JavaScript-based ad technologies for Cartoon Network and Adult Swim (Emmy Award Winner for 2019).

My strengths include problem solving, the ability to modify codebases, ability to work with multiple stakeholders to ensure that the work being done is understood and the expected solutions are delivered. Additional skills experience include: simplified documentation, Quality Assurance, and test strategies. Facilitating best practices in the software development life cycle, I am open to support my team in whichever way brings needed.

In addition to my professional experience, I have served as a Mentor for early-stage software engineers at Thinkful (a Chegg service), assisting students as they complete their journey into software development.
