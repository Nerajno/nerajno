## Hi there ✋🏽, Nerando here. 

## Brief Bio 
As a software developer with full-stack training and experience, I have served in a software development and  DevOps capacity while assisting a team of nine developers in the creation of a proprietary mortgage web platform. Our team worked on a new app and  used feature development in a modern Expo-based React/React Native SPA front-end with a Node.js back-end using MongoDB as storage. We worked on the integration of other middleware, new user workflows, and adding functionality that could support 5,000 concurrent users in the mortgage space.

As a Quality Assurance / Junior Software Engineer with a local Atlanta firm, I was responsible for creating and reviewing JavaScript-based ad technologies for Cartoon Network and Adult Swim (Emmy Award Winner for 2019).

My strengths include problem-solving, the ability to create and modify codebases, ability to work with multiple stakeholders to ensure that the work being done is understood and the expected solutions are delivered. Additional skills and experience include simplified documentation, Quality Assurance, and test strategies. Facilitating best practices in the software development life cycle, I am open to supporting my team in whichever way it is needed.

In addition to my professional experience, I have served as a Mentor for early-stage software engineers at Thinkful (a Chegg service) and Lighthouse, assisting students as they complete their journey into software development. Since 2018, I have co-organized the local FreeCodeCamp Atlanta chapter. As a team participant of [ATLC3 competition in 2018](https://medium.com/paratransit-pal/paratransit-pal-won-40-000-at-at-ts-atlanta-civic-coding-challenge-and-gave-it-all-to-charity-30bba157d92d), our team won the civic hacking project earning a prize of $40,000, donating it all to charities focused on disability and tech-education.
