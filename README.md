## Hi there ✋🏽, Nerando here. 

## Brief Bio 
 This is Nerando, he likes to use programming to solve problems, (Yup, He is a developer and community developer). Nerando has been a community organizer for freeCodeCamp Atlanta for over the last two - three  years. He has been to a few hackathons and is an infrequent blogger.

Nerando has worn a few hats before becoming a developer : lab technician, farmer, truck driver, middle school science teacher, business founder, tutor and a middle school literacy specialist. These turns in the road has enabled him learn fast, work well within a team, understand going "the extra mile" and having a different outlook while problem solving or developing solutions.

When not coding, Nerando enjoys cooking, reading, the act of creating something from nothing and the odd blog or podcast about the human mind (Hi, NPR). Most recently, he recently(Sept 2019) completed the Flatiron School's FullStack Software Engineering Immersive, which was a life altering experience and provided a better understanding and skill set of a fullstack developer.
