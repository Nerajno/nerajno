## Hi there ✋🏽, Nerando here. 

## Brief Bio 
  This is Nerando, he likes to solve problems using programming as a part of his toolkit, (Yup, He has, currently, skills of a full stack developer). He is currently the main community organizer for freeCodeCamp Atlanta and  has been to a few hackathons and is an infrequent blogger ( still working on that).

Nerando has worn a few hats before becoming a developer: lab technician, farmer, truck driver, middle school science teacher, business founder, tutor and middle school literacy specialist. These turns in his journey, has enabled him to learn fast, work well within a properly structured team, understand what going "the extra mile" means and have a different outlook while problem-solving or developing solutions.

When not coding, Nerando enjoys cooking, reading, the act of creating something from nothing and the odd blog or podcast about the human mind, creating good habits (Hi, NPR and Podcast Addict) or podcasts that reinforces the craft or help one to understand another point of view. After completing the Flatiron School's FullStack Software Engineering Immersive (Sept 2019) and serving time as QA/junior software developer at WarnerMedia, he is currently working as a Fullstack Developer with a focus on DevOps, at Equity Prime Mortgage in Atlanta. With some experience as the current local organizer of the FreeCodeCamp Atlanta  group, he has been able to help other people in their developer journey while working on his own and do some amount of speaking on the topics pertaining to learning and code.
